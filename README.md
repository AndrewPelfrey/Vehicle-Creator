# Vehicle-Creator

## Description

  This project is a command-line interface application built using TypeScript. It allows the user to create virtual vehicles such as cars, motorbikes, and trucks providing details like color, make, model, year, and even customizing their wheels. The application dynamically constructs objects for the created vehicles and stores them for further use.

  - Motivation: My motivation behind this project was to improve my understanding of TypeScript, working with interfaces and classes. I also wanted to build an interactive tool that could help provide a practical use for learning programming concepts.
  - Reason: I built this project to learn and to further my skills in TypeScript in a real world scenario working with classes and interactivity. It was an opportunity to challenge myself and put my newly learned skills to the test.
  - Problem Solved: This project simplifies the process of designing and organizing vehicle data. It provides a user-friendly way to input vehicle details, validates the input, and ensures the vehicle objects are consistent and well structured
  - What I Learned: How to structure TypeScript projects effectively, deepened my understanding of TypeScripts type system (including interfaces), implemented inheritance polymorphism in TypeScript, and how to create a dynamic and user-friendly application with inquirer.

  ## Installation

  Clone the repository, navigate to file directory, install dependencies (npm install), compile TypeScript files (npm run build) and run the application (npm start)

  ## Usage

  After starting the application, enter the details of the car you want to make. Then, you can start the car, make it speed up or slow down, turn left or right. If you made a truck, you can choose to tow vehicles. If you made a motorbike, you can do a wheelie. You can also get a printed list of all the cars specifications, or even choose to create a new vehicle.
